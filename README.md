# TestBits-quiz

Written in Java with Selenium webdriver

Assignment
Evaluate your ability to create a basic test automation script using a tool/framework of
your choice (Selenium, Cypress, Katalon, or Tosca), demonstrate an understanding of
reusable test design, good practices in scripting, and simulate realistic automation
scenarios.
You are required to write an automation test script to imulate the "User Submit
Timesheet" functionality.
1. Login to the system using dummy credentials (simulate login elements).
2. Navigate to the Timesheet module (create a placeholder element for this
module if it doesn’t exist).
3. Input simulated timesheet details (Username/ID, Date, Notes, and Hours) and
submit the timesheet using dummy elements.
4. Verify the timesheet submission by asserting a success message or checking
the entry in a simulated list of timesheets.
Additional Instructions:
 Use placeholder or dummy elements in place of real UI elements. Document the
element names you create and map them clearly to each step.
 Make test data (Username/ID, Date, Notes, Hours) parameterized to allow
reusability with diƯerent inputs.
 Write assertions for each step (e.g., successful login, navigation to timesheet
module, successful submission) using simulated success indicators.
 Implement error handling in case of failures like incorrect login or missing fields.
